# Coin Change: Minimum # of coins required to make a change

Given a set of coins and amount, write an algoÂ­rithm to find out minimum number of coins that you need to make change of S amount


## Example:

Amount = 5

coins [] = {1,2,3}

Total ways to make change = 5

{1,1,1,1,1} {1,1,1,2}, {1,2,2}, {1,1,3} {2,3}

As we see minimum number of coins we need 2 {2+3 = 5}
