# Max Diff in an Array

Given an array, find the maximum difference. Index of max number should be greater than that of min number. Return 0 otherwise.

## Example
{5, 1, 3, 4, 2} <br />
Index of 5 is smaller than index of 1. So discard 5 and consider 4 as the max number. And thus return (4-1)=3


{5, 4, 3, 2, 1} <br />
For this case, index of any max number is smaller than that of min number. So return 0
