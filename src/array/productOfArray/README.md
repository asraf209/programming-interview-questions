# Product of Array Except Self

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

## Examples

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: [24,12,8,6]



Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]

Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
