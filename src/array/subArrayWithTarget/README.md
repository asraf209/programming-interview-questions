# Find a continuous sub-sequence with a target value, if exists

Given an integer Array find the continuous sub-sequence which sums up to the target value


## Example

Given array={30, 5, 16, 13, 3, 24, 19, 1, 25}, and target = 47,

Return the sub-sequence index (4, 7)

For target value of 50, it should return null
