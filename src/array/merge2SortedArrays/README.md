# Merge two sorted Arrays with O(1) space

We are given two sorted arrays. We need to merge these two arrays such that the initial numbers (after complete sorting) are in the first array and the remaining numbers are in the second array. No extra space allowed.


## Example

Input: ar1[] = {1, 5, 9, 10, 15, 20}; <br />
       ar2[] = {2, 3, 8, 13};
       
Output: ar1[] = {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9}	<br />
        ar2[] = {10, 13, 15, 20}
