# Invert a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree as follows

	   	   100		
	 	  /   \		
	   60      150
	  / \		/  \
	30	 80  120 200
	 	 	  
Return

	   	   100		
	 	  /   \		
	   150     60
	  / \		/  \
	200	 120  80  30
	  


## Keep in Mind

Children of every node needs to be inverted


## Complexity

	Time: O(n)
	
	Space: O(1)
