# Reverse K-elements in a singly linked list

Write a program to reverse K elements of a linked list, starting from Head. 

## Examples

Input: 	1->2->3->4->5->6->7->NULL 	<br /> 
K = 3
 
Output: 3->2->1->6->5->4->7->NUL


## Solutions

I have made the one with Stack. This requires some memory space.

Another approach is defined [here](../reverseList/ReverseList.java)
